# stdr_control
An minimal, example node to illustrate control of the STDR mobile robot with open-loop commands.

## Example usage
`roslaunch stdr_launchers server_with_map_and_gui_plus_robot.launch`
to start the simulator.  Run a simple, open-loop command sequence with:
`rosrun stdr_control stdr_open_loop_commander`

Code has been updated by Andrew Riemer to move the STDR mobile robot from the bottom left hand corner of the map to the upper left hand corner
